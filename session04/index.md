##Libraries

###Libraries are awesome

The strength of a language lies as much in the set of libraries available, as it does
in the language itself.

A great set of libraries allows for a very powerful programming style:

* Write minimal code yourself
* Choose the right libraries
* Plug them together
* Create impressive results

Not only is this efficient with your programming time, it's also more efficient with computer
time.

The chances are any algorithm you might want to use has already been programmed better by someone else.
