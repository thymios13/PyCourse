##Design

###Design

In this session, we will finally discuss the thing most people think of when they refer to "Software Engineering": the deliberate *design* of software.
We will discuss processes and methodologies for planned development of large-scale software projects: *Software Architecture*.

This lecture is available as an [IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/development.rc.ucl.ac.uk/training/engineering/session06/session06/python/session06.ipynb)

###Object-Oriented Design

The software engineering community has, in large part, focused on an object-oriented approach to the design and development of large scale software systems.
The basic concepts of object orientation are necessary to follow much of the software engineering conversation.

###Design processes

In addition to object-oriented architecture, software engineers have focused on the development of processes for robust, reliable software development. 
These codified ways of working hope to enable organisations to repeatably and reliably complete complex software projects in a way that minimises both development 
and maintainance costs, and meets user requirements.

###Design and research

Software engineering theory has largely been developed in the context of commercial software companies.

The extent to which the practices and processes developed for commercial software are applicable in a research context is itself an active area of research.
