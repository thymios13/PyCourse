## Week 1 Exercise

### Exercises

* Each week during the course, there will be an assessed homework exercise.
* This will be a pass/fail exercise, submitted through Git, which we will learn about next week.

This first week, the exercise will not be assessed, since we're still getting the tools up and running.

### Installation of Python and IPython Notebook

Instead, please concentrate on making sure you've completed the installation instructions, and can run a 
python file on your computer through the command line, and load an IPython notebook.

### Installation of git

Please make sure you can run git at the command line ready for next session:

``` bash
git --version
mkdir git_test
cd git_test
git init
<edit a file called "test.txt">
git add .
git commit -m "Example commit"
cd ..
rm -rf git_test
```

### Sign up on GitHub

Go to [GitHub](http://github.com) and create yourself an account, if you haven't already

### Look at some IPython Notebooks

Download yourself some IPython notebooks from [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)
Load them up, and have a play.
